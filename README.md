# greedy-wordle-solver
A greedy attempt at finding the best first word for Wordle. This aims analysis is based on the assumption that the best first word to guess is the one that leaves the lowest average number of possible words for the second guess. Whether this assumption is actually true is up to you to decide.

Unfortunately the .csv output from this algorithm is far too big to put up here but the word that is chosen by this method is...
### `ROATE`
... which I didn't even know was a word
